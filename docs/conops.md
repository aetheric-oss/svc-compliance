## :raised_hands: Motivation

Our network may be able to provide the following services for asset owners:
- Submitting flight plans to the regional aviation authority
- Obtaining flight releases prior to takeoff
- Validating certification numbers and expiration dates

For safe aircraft routing, the network should have a way to obtain:
- [Temporary flight restrictions](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/temporary_flight_restrictions) (TFRs)
- [Waypoints/Fixes](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/aero_data/loc_id_search/fixes_waypoints/)
